# Google ADK Agent Samples

Welcome to The AI Language official repository for Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) sample applications. This collection is designed to provide practical, hands-on examples of how to build powerful and creative agents using the ADK framework.

The goal of this repository is to showcase different architectural patterns—from simple, single-purpose agents to complex, multi-agent systems. Each project is self-contained and includes a detailed `README.md` with specific setup and usage instructions.

## 🌱 Available Agent Projects

This collection is actively growing. Below are the current agent examples available.

### 1. Simple Website Builder (`version_1_website_builder_simple`)

*   **Architecture:** Single-Agent System
*   **Description:** A minimal ADK application featuring a single LLM-powered agent. It takes a natural language prompt (e.g., "create a page with a blue button") and generates a complete, self-contained HTML file.
*   **Best for:** Understanding the fundamentals of an ADK agent, including instructions, tools, and basic I/O.
*   **➡️ For detailed instructions, see the `README.md` inside the [`version_1_website_builder_simple/`](./version_1_website_builder_simple/) directory.**

### 2. Sequential Website Builder (`version_2_sequential_website_agent`)

*   **Architecture:** Multi-Agent, Sequential Orchestration
*   **Description:** A more advanced system where a "root" agent orchestrates a team of specialized agents in a sequence to build a website. This mimics a real-world development workflow: `Requirements Writer` -> `Designer` -> `Code Writer`.
*   **Best for:** Learning how to build complex workflows by chaining agents together, where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next.
*   **➡️ For detailed instructions, see the `README.md` inside the [`version_2_sequential_website_agent/`](./version_2_sequential_website_agent/) directory.**

### 3. Intelligent Research-Driven Website Builder (`version_3_parallel_research_agent`)

*   **Architecture:** Multi-Agent, Sequential + Parallel Orchestration
*   **Description:** An advanced system that combines intelligent research capabilities with parallel processing. Takes a simple topic input and transforms it into a comprehensive research report webpage through a 6-agent pipeline: `Questions Generator` -> `5 Parallel Research Agents` -> `Query Generator` -> `Requirements Writer` -> `Designer` -> `Code Writer`.
*   **Best for:** Learning parallel agent execution, Google search integration, research-driven development, and complex multi-agent orchestration with both sequential and parallel patterns.
*   **➡️ For detailed instructions, see the `README.md` inside the [`intelligent_research_website_builder/`](./intelligent_research_website_builder/) directory.**

### 4. Cloud-Deployable Research Website Builder (`version_4_deploy_to_gcloud`)

*   **Architecture:** Multi-Agent, Sequential + Parallel Orchestration with Cloud Deployment
*   **Description:** An enhanced version of the intelligent research-driven website builder specifically configured for Google Cloud Run deployment. Features the same sophisticated 6-agent research pipeline but includes deployment infrastructure with FastAPI integration, containerization, and cloud-ready configuration.
*   **Best for:** Learning how to deploy ADK multi-agent systems to production cloud environments, understanding containerization of agent workflows, and building scalable cloud-native agent applications.
*   **➡️ For detailed instructions, see the `README.md` inside the [`version_4_deploy_to_gcloud/`](./version_4_deploy_to_gcloud/) directory.**

### 5. Config-Based AI Tutor Agent (`version_5_config_type`)

*   **Architecture:** Multi-Agent, Config-Based
*   **Description:** Demonstrates the config-based agent feature of the ADK. The agent logic, structure, and instructions are defined entirely in YAML files, requiring zero Python code for the core agent implementation. A root agent routes questions to specialized `python_tutor_agent` or `physics_tutor_agent` sub-agents.
*   **Best for:** Learning how to create modular, declarative, and code-light AI systems using YAML configuration.
*   **➡️ For detailed instructions, see the `README.md` inside the [`version_5_config_type/`](./version_5_config_type/) directory.**

### 6. No-Code Visual Agent Builder (`version_6_adk_nocode`)

*   **Architecture:** No-Code, Visual Builder
*   **Description:** Introduces the ADK's no-code visual builder (`adk web`), a canvas-based UI for creating agents without writing Python code. The example walks through creating a simple web page generator using both manual configuration and the experimental Gemini-powered Builder Assistant.
*   **Best for:** Getting started with the visual agent builder, understanding the no-code/low-code capabilities of the ADK, and seeing how the UI maps to YAML agent configurations.
*   **➡️ For detailed instructions, see the `README.md` inside the [`version_6_adk_nocode/`](./version_6_adk_nocode/) directory.**


We will be adding more agents over time to demonstrate other patterns like parallel execution, agents with memory, and more complex tool usage.

## 🚀 General Setup Instructions

While each project has its own specific dependencies, the following setup steps are common to all agents in this repository.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theailanguage/adk_samples.git
```

### 2. Set Up Your API Key

To use the agents, you need a Google API key.

1.  Navigate into the specific project folder you want to run (e.g., `version_2_sequential_website_agent`).
2.  Create a file named `.env` in that directory.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
```

You can get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### 3. Set Up the Python Environment (Unified Workspace)

This repository is configured as a **unified `uv` workspace**. You do not need to create individual virtual environments for each project. All dependencies are managed globally at the root.

```bash
# Navigate to the root directory of the repository
cd adk_samples

# Sync dependencies for all projects at once
uv sync
```

This will create a single `.venv` at the root and install all required libraries across all sub-projects.

---

## 🤖 Running an Agent

After syncing the workspace, you can navigate into any sub-project and use `uv run` to start the agent. It will automatically use the unified root environment.

1.  Make sure you are in the project's root directory in your terminal.
2.  Launch the ADK web server (or run the python script) using `uv run`:

```bash
# For projects with a flat agent structure (like v1)
cd version_1_website_builder_simple/
uv run adk web ./agents

# For projects with a main.py entrypoint (like v10)
cd version_10_agent_platform_office_team/
uv run main.py
```

3.  If using `adk web`, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
4.  Select the desired agent from the dropdown menu and start interacting with it!
